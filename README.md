# Hacking_C_and_Unix_Binaries

# About
This is a repo containing all the experiments I did while pursuing the course "Hacking C and Unix Binaries" at University of Maryland,College Park. These documents contains detailed explanations of exploiting C programs including aim, background research, methodology, results and limitations if any. Along with relevant pictures and code snippets follow each experiment.

# Purpose
All these files deep dive into a particular topic (along with research) in C language and is a reference for future work. Most of the experiments exploit some form of vulnerability in C and provides an insight what not to do while coding. All approaches are meant for learning and learning only and not to be done without prior permission in a environment not owned by us. The codes have been executed in a personal VM environment.

# Contents
The files are created using Latex. Any references like websites, research papers or personal blogs used are present as hyperlinks in relevant keywords. There is no separate "References" for these. The only reason being it is educational in nature and not for publishing as original content. Also, it is easier to visit the link and read about a specific topic as when it appears in the file.

# Final Note
Please do not copy the contents without prior permission, rather feel free to learn and develop your own exploits with explanations. I will not be responsible if copyright is violated if some these is published without the consent of original author(for relevant sections).
